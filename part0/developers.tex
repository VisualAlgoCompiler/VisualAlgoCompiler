\section{part0}
For part0, I have two sources files. The first one is main.c, which includes two helper methods and one main method, these two helper methods are used to display the usage and version information, and the main method takes the input of users as the argument to produce the output. Another file is a makefile, which makes building and cleaning the compiler easy.\\
